# Furry Virus

This story is completely satire, sarcastic and is just a joke.

Day 1: Furry virus is a virus that was created back in 2014 in a lab and was kept a secret. One day, a man named Janek was playing basketball, but he fell, after a few seconds he started to feel a burning sensation in his ass. He fell on a syringe that appeared from nowhere.

Day 2: Janek woke up, and he felt different, he raised his hands to look at them...

*He had only paws.*

Janek became terrified, that is when, his friend looked in his window, and noticed he is wearing a strange suit that looked like a furry.

*They didn't know anything yet.*

Janek started panicking more and more, until he felt something, he can become a human again by his will, he decided to keep it a secret, when he came to school that day, his friend started joking, and the rest started joking too. 
After a few seconds, he became furious, he started shifting into the furry form, his *** started splitting and the furry skin started taking over, he started throwing his friends around until they all vomited, then, something happened, he fell to the floor, and his *protogen* mask stopped emitting any light, he started to come back to the human form, police arrived, but when they took eyes off Janek, he disappeared without a trace.

Day 7: The search is still going on, no one had hope in finding him until, well, everyone forgot, some agents have arrived that day, and they wiped all the memory about the incident, so noone knows what happened, and they can bring back Janek, except the friend that saw all by himself, everything was stuck in his head, nobody believed him, he tried convincing all of them, but nothing happened, that is when, that exact friend, was captured and taken to the lab, he became a worker there and started working.

Day 45: That friend is still keeping everything quiet,
